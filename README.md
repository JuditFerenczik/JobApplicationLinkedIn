linkedIn automatic job search and save

After saving personal data in secret.py, the script automatically logs in to linkedIn. According to the previously added criteria(python developer and location),
it searches for the listed job offerings. It is not required to save the previously saved jobs so the different ID-s of these are written in a txt file which is
read after the start of the script. At the end it prints the new jobs' pagelocation, weblocation and their title to help the checking.
